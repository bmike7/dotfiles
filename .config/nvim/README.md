Custom neovim setup from scratch

# Interesting plugins I want to use:

## Package management
- ✅ lazy as package manager
- ✅ mason for installing lsp servers, linters, ...

## Fuzzy search
- ✅ Telescope ofcourse with grep (Rust 😎)

## LSP stuff
- ✅ mason lsp config (suggested in mason help pages)

## linting & formatting
- ✅ ALE?

To start with I want to have tools to support development
with following languages:
- Python
- ✅ Rust
- JS(X), TS(X). Hopefully don't need to use them, but you never know...

## Completion
- ✅ coq.nvim 🚀🧨 (SQLite backed, might be overkill,
but I want to see it with my own eyes)

## File management
- ✅ oil.nvim (in a floating window? 🤔)

## General
- ✅ jk as <Esc> and such...
- ✅ " " leader
- ✅ cursor offset
- ✅ number (relative)
- ✅ tmux like navigation
- ✅ automatic closing of brackets
- ✅ tree-sitter
- ✅ floating windows
- DAP 🤞 (struggled with this in the past, hope it was
because of fighting with preconfigured setup of others)
- ✅ "python playground" (REPL in floating window)
- ✅ lazygit floating window
- ✅ lazydocker floating window
- show git changes in files
- styling (Gorilla 🦍)

- task automations (cross directory?...)
