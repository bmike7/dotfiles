# Custom neovim setup ðŸš€

Neovim is my IDE of choice. In the meantime I've spent a lot of time
polishing the setup which works for me, but probably it will never
feel finished.
Which is a good thing IMO. Why? Feel free to reach out.

Since this is a WIP, the way of development may vary over time as
well. It also depends on the languages that I use daily. Here, I'ld
like to collect links to more specific workflows for future me.

As of writing, I mainly work in following two languages:

* Rust
* Python

The latter one can use a guide: sadly `Python` doesn't have an amazing
`Cargo` alternative.
Because: [How to manage `Python` environments and packages?](docs/python.md)
